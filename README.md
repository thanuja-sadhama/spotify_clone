# spotify_clone
This is a static Spotify clone built using HTML, CSS. It mimics the basic layout and visual design of Spotify's web interface, focusing on the front-end elements without any backend or music streaming functionality. The purpose of this project is to practice front-end development and to showcase the use of responsive design, Flexbox, Grid, and CSS animations.
Homepage Layout: A simple, responsive homepage similar to Spotify's dashboard, featuring side navigation, content sections, and a player bar.
Navigation Bar: A static side navigation bar that includes links to "Home," "Search," "Your Library," and "Playlist."
Dummy Content: Includes placeholders for album covers, playlists, and songs, giving a close resemblance to Spotify's structure.
Sticky Player Bar: A static music player bar at the bottom of the screen, imitating the Spotify player, without real audio playback functionality.
